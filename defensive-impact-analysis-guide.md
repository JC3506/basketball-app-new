## Understanding Defensive Metrics

### Contest Efficiency

Contest efficiency measures how effectively defenders are contesting shots:

```
Contest Efficiency = (Missed Shots When Contested / Total Contested Shots) × 100%
```

A higher percentage indicates more effective defense.

### Zone Defense Efficiency

Zone defense efficiency shows how well the team defends specific areas of the court:

```
Zone Defense Efficiency = (Missed Shots in Zone / Total Shots in Zone) × 100%
```

### Contest Level Distribution

Contest level distribution shows the intensity of defensive pressure:

- **Uncontested**: Defender not close enough to affect the shot
- **Light Contest**: Minimal defensive pressure
- **Medium Contest**: Moderate defensive pressure
- **Heavy Contest**: Significant defensive pressure
- **Blocked**: Shot was blocked by the defender

## Best Practices

1. **Be Consistent**: Record defensive data for all shots to ensure comprehensive analysis
2. **Be Accurate**: Take care to position defenders accurately on the court
3. **Use Contest Levels Appropriately**: Be consistent in how you categorize contest intensity
4. **Review Regularly**: Check defensive insights after each quarter to make tactical adjustments
5. **Compare Matchups**: Use matchup data to inform defensive assignments

## Tips for Coaches

- Use the defensive impact chart to identify areas where your team excels or struggles defensively
- Review contest level distribution to assess defensive intensity
- Analyze individual defender performance to optimize defensive assignments
- Use zone defense efficiency to adjust defensive schemes
- Leverage AI insights to make data-driven defensive adjustments during games

## Conclusion
